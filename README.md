# Magento Destroyers
Magento checkout frontend has been driving me insane for the last couple of weeks. So I did the only sane thing and created a simple game to vent the aggression towards the "fantastic" "magento development experiance"â„¢. This game is released as part of a rant on my blog so feel free to check that out [here](https://iamwlad.com/blog). This game is build using ThreeJS and since it is my first Three project I probably overseen something terrible so please don't be too hard on me for any errors :) 

You can check out the game in action [here](https://magento-destroyers.iamwlad.com), have some fun.
